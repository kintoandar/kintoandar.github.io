<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://ptcoresec.eu/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nNKcJRlAyUQ/UPLuXZdhbqI/AAAAAAAAApw/KR_F_ZLvIRs/s200/ptcoresec.png" width="175" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />For a year now, I've been a member of a Portuguese security research group named <a href="http://ptcoresec.eu/" target="_blank">PTCoreSec</a>. It all started as a way to give something back to the infosec community. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As you probably have noticed I really don't have much time to keep this blog flowing with regular posts, but I've gathered the time I could to help PTcoreSec, which I believe provides help and education about information security problems to professionals and the common citizen alike, and that's something to be <b>proud</b> of. Besides, the team is just amazing and the fun never ends!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> I contribute to the team with the blog posts I write, worked in a couple of Capture the Flag challenges for the 2012 <a href="http://www.just4meeting.com/2012/index.html" target="_blank">Just4Meeting</a>, in particular one I'm very proud of, but perhaps </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I'll </span>write a post about that. I've also been invited to write an article for a Portuguese <a href="http://www.revista-programar.info/" target="_blank">online technology magazine</a>, curious enough it coincided with a new box I've assembled with a state of the art graphics card.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iwT5kysTm7g/UPqOYFfZ0sI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/zH36SVcNFb4/s1600/pap.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iwT5kysTm7g/UPqOYFfZ0sI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/zH36SVcNFb4/s200/pap.jpg" width="200" /></a><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As I'm keen on password auditing, I've choosen this topic for the article. Giving a quick intro about hashes, salt and cracking techniques, and with the help of&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/synchroack" target="_blank">@synchroack</a>, we've benchmarked </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><a href="http://hashcat.net/" target="_blank">hashcat</a> against md5, sha1, sha256, sha512 and md5 + salt via GPU and via CPU.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Besides the outstanding results, this article also provides all the information needed to successfully audit passwords on a relatively cheap hardware configuration. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Curious enough, our article was voted the best of that edition and here's the prize T-Shirt to prove it :)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You can find the magazine <a href="http://www.revista-programar.info/?action=editions&amp;type=viewmagazine&amp;n=37" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/89116509/Revista_PROGRAMAR_37.pdf" target="_blank">there</a>, but I must warn you it's written in Portuguese, nonetheless the benchmark data speaks for itself and any question you may have feel free to ask me, I'll gladly help.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><br />
