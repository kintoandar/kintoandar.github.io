When I got my first job as a Linux sysadmin, I built a small PC to practice as much as I could on all the cool technologies I wanted to learn, and not only the stuff needed for the current job I had at that moment. That mindset escalated quickly, and the PC became a full blown server running multiple VMs, services, different network segments and with a pretty decent uptime (almost 99.0% even without UPS).

I must admit it has crossed my mind to host a box in the so called “cloud”, but I was too proud of and had too much fun with my personal infrastructure to come to that. Besides, as a major plus, the server was sitting on my living room, tuck away on my TV cabinet, and doubled as a HTPC.

After a while, requests rolled in to host several websites for friends and family, which made me to get things a little more professional and dig in DNS (pun intended), service tuning, availability and scalability.

After 7 years, the time has come to seriously upgrade the machine and I started searching the best way to balance power consumption, performance, noise, longevity and price. This was the end result:

| Case | Cooler Master Elite 110 Mini-ITX |
| Motherboard | Asus H81I-PLUS Mini-ITX |
| Processor | Intel Core i3 4340 (3.60 GHz) |
| Heatsink | Zalman CNPS8900 Quiet |
| RAM | Dimm 8GB DDR3 Crucial CL9 1600Mhz Ballistix |
| Disk | Western Digital SATAIII 1TB 7200rpm 64Mb Black 6Gb/s |
| PSU | Silverstone SFX 300W 80 Plus Bronze |


All the hardware assembly went on without any issues, the case is very versatile for its size and with plenty of space to add more storage capability. Never have used a SFX format PSU before and I was happily surprised by its size, giving a lot more room inside the case and deploying all the required power very quietly.

The new haswell processor architecture provides a major boost between performance and power consumption and the integrated GPU is more than enough for 1080p playback. Hey, even if you are wondering if gaming is possible in a ring like this, the answer is _hell yeah_, it counts as my own version of a steam box.

Regarding the software, there are two main purposes to consider, HTPC and Server, I will give a quick overview of the most important bits of each.

## The HTPC

On the HTPC side I went with [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/) as the default operating system. It has [Cinnamon](http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/) by default, completely compatible with the hardware I’ve bought and with all the [PPAs](https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA) to choose from - package installation was a breeze. 

Obviously, [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) has to be running. It's the best media center out there and I’ve been using it since it was only on the xbox. A while back I got a [lightpack](http://lightpack.tv/) strapped to my TV. With [boblightd](http://code.google.com/p/boblight/wiki/boblightd) and XBMC working together I’ve achieved an astounding ambilight experience.

Last but not least, [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) got installed because gaming is awesome.

## The Server

As for the Server, pretty much every service runs inside a virtual machine, [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/) has been my hypervisor of choice for some years now. My KVM manages several [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) boxes built by function. Recently I’ve also started using [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to get the hang of [Docker](http://www.docker.com/) and to spin up environments for testing.

[Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) remains my faithful watchdog and keeps an eye on things for me, while [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net/) enforces the security policy in place and integrates with nagios for alerting on when something is fishy.

[Screen](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNU_Screen) is always on so I keep an instance of [IRSSI](http://www.irssi.org/) connected to [#freenode](https://freenode.net/) and another of [rtorrent](http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/), just for legal downloads obviously.

To get all of my DNS A records updated, as I don’t have public static IP addresses, [ddclient](http://sourceforge.net/p/ddclient/wiki/Home/) does its magic.

No decent home server would be finished without providing a NAS, and [Samba](http://www.samba.org/) takes care of that quite nicely.

Well, there you go, the reasons I went through all this trouble and an insight on the most important stuff running in my new box. Yeah, I could have a NAS + Raspberry Pi + a couple of AWS/DigitalOcean/whatever instances, but:
> What would be the fun in that?
