Our event is call TEDx (place), where x=independently organized TED event. At our TEDx (place) event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.<br />The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized. </blockquote><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Today was my birthday and this year for something completely different I attended TEDxO'Porto. </div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The result was outstanding, best social event I've ever had the pleasure of attending. The mandatory networking between TEDxesters was plain fun, giving a chance of meeting old friends and, who knows, creating new ones. With an excellent choice of speakers, the talks were inspiring, mesmerizing and life changing.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />I can't stress enough, this event is as awesome as it is overwhelming! </div>
