## [What is TEDx?](http://www.ted.com/tedx)

>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program calledTEDx.
>TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is call TEDx (place), where x=independently organized TED event. At our TEDx (place) event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.
>The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

Today was my birthday and this year, for something completely different, I attended TEDxO'Porto.

The result was outstanding, best social event I've ever had the pleasure of attending. The mandatory networking between TEDxesters was plain fun, giving a chance of meeting old friends and, who knows, creating new ones. With an excellent choice of speakers, the talks were inspiring, mesmerizing and life changing. 

I can't stress enough, this event is as awesome as it is overwhelming!
