As previously announced, last Saturday, I attended as a [speaker at PortoLinux technical meeting](http://portolinux.org/doku.php?id=encontrostecnicos:marco10) at [FEUP](http://www.fe.up.pt/). 
My main goal was to give an overview of the main services I've on my personal infrastructure, which explains the chosen title ["There's no place like 127.0.0.1"](/images/there-s_no_place_like_home.pdf).

Among other services, I've managed to talk about:
* torrentflux
* vnstat
* xbmc
* vmware
* webminstats
* nrpe
* vino-server
* synergy
* samba/nfs
* rsync
* cron
* ntpd
* ssmtp
* motion
* screen + irssi
* hts + htc
* squid
* no-ip2
* apache virtualhosts
* awffull
* webdav
* tomcat alfresco
* mod_jk
* mod_security
* snort
* B.A.S.E.
* IPtables
* fwsnort
* psad
* IPsec
* OpenVPN
* ssh ppp vpn
* Nagios
* NO2DB
* nagiosgrapher
* OSSEC
