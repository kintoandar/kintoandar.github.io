### Hi there,

I'm an engineer, published author, open-source supporter and contributor, with a keen interest in all things infrastructure. I'm a geek by definition while curious by nature. The thing I treasure the most is knowledge, and thankfully, there's plenty of that to go around.

On the community side, I use my [Blog](https://blog.kintoandar.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/kintoandar) and [IRC](https://libera.chat/) to help free and open-source software users out there as much as I can.

My work-related experience includes:
  * Several security-oriented roles
  * Infrastructure automation and delivery
  * Site reliability engineering
  * Architecture
  * Leadership and management

For the last few years, I've been helping startups tackle hypergrowth. You can read all about it on my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelbastos/).

On the hobbies side, I try my best to keep active. As such, [my sports of choice](https://www.strava.com/athletes/kintoandar) are running and swimming, but I recently picked up surfing and surfskate as well ü§ô always with the support of my loyal friend [Byte Von Snort](https://www.instagram.com/bytevonsnort).


Welcome to the blog, hope it's useful ‚ù§Ô∏è
