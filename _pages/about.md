### Hi there,

I'm an engineer, author, open source supporter and contributor. Have a keen interest in all things infrastructure, I'm a geek by definition and curious by nature. The thing I treasure the most is knowledge, thankfully there's plenty of that to go around.

On the community side, I use my this blog, [GitHub](https://github.com/kintoandar) and [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/) to help free and open source software users out there as much as I can.

Regarding my work-related experience, it includes security oriented roles, infrastructure automation and delivery, site reliability engineering and architecture, for more context head on over to [my Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelbastos/) page.

Last but not least, I have the weird habit of addressing everyone as dude/dudette, so don't be surprised.
