  I'm an Open Source supporter, since I can remember. Have a keen interest on infosec and I'm totally into the devops culture. The thing I treasure the most is know-how, thank god there's plenty of that to go around.
<br>
<br>
  On the community side, I'm a [Porto Linux](http://portolinux.org/) member, wrote a couple of articles for [PTCoreSec](http://ptcoresec.eu/) and I use my blog and Freenode IRC to help FOSS users out there as much as I can.

  Regarding my work related experience it includes several internships at my previous university, R&D at Critical Software (security and Infrastructure team) and I have been a sysadmin at Multicert, a PKI company which you may know for projects like the Portuguese Citizen Card and ePassport. Nowadays you can find me as a Linux application engineer at Blip (a Betfair company), performing Linux wizardry in a devops environment. For more info regarding my professional career and/or expertise, please take a look in my Linkedin page.

  Last but not least, I have the strange habit of addressing everyone as dude/duddet, so don't be surprised.
