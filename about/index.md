#### Hi there,
   I'm an Open Source supporter, since I can remember. Have a keen interest on infosec and I'm totally into the devops culture. The thing I treasure the most is know-how, thank god there's plenty of that to go around.
<br>
<br>
  On the community side, I'm a [Porto Linux](http://portolinux.org/) member, wrote a couple of articles for [PTCoreSec](http://blog.kintoandar.com/2013/01/ptcoresec-because-security-matters.html) and I use my blog and Freenode IRC to help FOSS users out there as much as I can.
<br>
<br>
  Regarding my work related experience it includes several internships at my previous university, R&D at [Critical Software](http://www.criticalsoftware.com/) (security and Infrastructure team) and I have been a sysadmin at [Multicert](https://www.multicert.com), the Portuguese Certification Authority which you may know for projects like the Portuguese Citizen Card and ePassport. Nowadays you can find me as a Linux application engineer at [Blip](http://www.blip.pt/) (a [Betfair](http://corporate.betfair.com/) company), performing Linux wizardry in a devops environment. For more info regarding my professional career and/or expertise, please take a look in my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelbastos) page.
<br>

  Last but not least, I have the strange habit of addressing everyone as dude/dudette, so don't be surprised.
