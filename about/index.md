#### Hi there,
   I'm an Open Source supporter and contributor, since I can remember. Have a keen interest on infosec and I'm totally into the devops culture. The thing I treasure the most is know-how, thank god there's plenty of that to go around.
<br>
<br>
  On the community side, I use my [blog](https://blog.kintoandar.com), [github](https://github.com/kintoandar) and [freenode](https://freenode.net) to help free and open source software users out there as much as I can.
<br>
<br>
  Regarding my work related experience, it includes security oriented roles, infrastructure automation and delivery, site reliability engineering and architecture. For more context, head on over to my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelbastos/).
<br>
<br>
  Last but not least, I have the strange habit of addressing everyone as dude/dudette, so don't be surprised.
